/**
 * Auth0 JWT Verification Module
 *
 * Used by EVERY Edge Function to validate the caller's identity.
 *
 * WHY we verify the JWT instead of trusting client-provided user IDs:
 *   - A client can send any user_id value in a request body.
 *   - Auth0 JWTs are cryptographically signed with Auth0's private RSA key.
 *   - By verifying the signature against Auth0's public JWKS endpoint, we
 *     confirm the token was genuinely issued by our Auth0 tenant.
 *   - The 'sub' claim from a verified token is the only authoritative user ID.
 *
 * WHY audience AND issuer checks both matter:
 *   - Issuer: ensures the token came from OUR Auth0 tenant, not another.
 *   - Audience: ensures the token was requested for THIS API specifically.
 *     Without it, a valid token issued for a different service could be
 *     replayed here (token substitution attack).
